See :doc:`INSTALL` for installation instructions. `Documentation`_ is
mostly provided through the python doc strings. See `Download and
Availability`_ for download instructions if the instructions in
:doc:`INSTALL` are not sufficient.

There is also auto-generated `online source code documentation`_
available.

Please be aware that this is **alpha** software that most definitely
contains bugs. It is *your* responsibility to ensure that you are
running simulations with sensible parameters.

In case of problems please direct error reports to `Oliver Beckstein`_
in the first instance as these bugs might not have been present in the
original software or files.

Included third party content:

GridMat-MD
  - Grid-based Membrane Analysis Tool for use with Molecular Dynamics
    [Allen2009]_
  - version 1.0.2
  - available under GPL 3.0  
  - W. J. Allen, J. A. Lemkul, and D. R. Bevan. (2009) "GridMAT-MD: A

Free energy perturbation input files
  ``mdp`` run input files from David Mobley's `Free Energy Tutorial`_
  are included in the ``templates`` directory as examples for FEP
  calculations. If you use these files please *read* David's
  tutorial and all relevant papers [Mobley2007]_ and *do* the tutorial first!

Citing
======

If you find this package useful and use it in published work I'd be
grateful if it was acknowledged in text as

  "... used GromacsWrapper (Oliver Beckstein,
  http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/oliver/software/GromacsWrapper/)"

or in the Acknowledgements section.

If you use the ``gridmatmd`` plugin also cite [Allen2009]_.

The free energy parameters in David Mobley's FEP example files are
similar to the ones used in [Mobley2007]_ so you might consider citing
this paper.

Thank you.
