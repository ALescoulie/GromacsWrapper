   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to GromacsWrapper's documentation!
==========================================

**GromacsWrapper** is a python package that wraps system calls to
`Gromacs`_ tools into thin classes. This allows for fairly seamless
integration of the gromacs tools into python scripts. This is
generally superior to shell scripts because of python's better error
handling and superior data structures. It also allows for
modularization and code re-use.

See :doc:`INSTALL` for installation instructions. `Documentation`_ is
only provided through the python doc strings. 

There is also auto-generated `online source code documentation`_
available.

Please be aware that this is **alpha** software that most definitely
contains bugs. It is *your* responsibility to ensure that you are
running simulations with sensible parameters.

The documentation is still in flux and any suggestions and
contributions are welcome. See the package :doc:`README` for contact
details.
