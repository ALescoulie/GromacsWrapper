   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

====================================================
  GromacsWrapper --- a python framework for Gromacs
====================================================

**GromacsWrapper** is a python package that wraps system calls to
Gromacs_ tools into thin classes. This allows for fairly seamless
integration of the gromacs tools into python_ scripts. This is
generally superior to shell scripts because of python's better error
handling and superior data structures. It also allows for
modularization and code re-use. In addition, commands, warnings and
errors are logged to a file so that there exists a complete history of
what has been done.

See :doc:`INSTALL` for download and installation instructions. `Documentation`_
is primarily provided through the python doc strings (from which most of the
online documentation is generated).

There is also auto-generated `online source code documentation`_
available.

.. warning:: Please be aware that this is **alpha** software that most
  definitely contains bugs. The API is not stable and can change
  between releases.
  
  It is *your* responsibility to ensure that you are running
  simulations with sensible parameters.

The package and the documentation are still in flux and any feedback,
bug reports, suggestions and contributions are very welcome. See the
package :doc:`README` for contact details.

For other approaches to interfacing python_ and Gromacs_ see
:doc:`alternatives`.
