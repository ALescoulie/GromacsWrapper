====================
  Analysis plugins
====================

Analysis plugins consist of a book-keeping class derived from
:class:`gromacs.analysis.core.Plugin` and a "worker" class (a child of
:class:`gromacs.analysis.core.Worker`), which contains the actual
analysis code.

----------
 Plugins
----------

Plugin modules are named like the plugin class, i.e. the filename is
capitalized. This makes it easier to distinguish plugins from `Helper
modules`_ that are also part of the package.

.. automodule:: gromacs.analysis.plugins
.. automodule:: gromacs.analysis.plugins.CysAccessibility

-----------------
 Helper modules	
-----------------

Various helper classes that can be used by plugins. Because they are
not necessarily restricted to a single plugin they have been moved
into separate modules for code reuse.

.. automodule:: gromacs.analysis.plugins.dist
