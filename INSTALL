 INSTALL
=========

This document should help you to install the package. The installation
uses setuptools (also known as easy_install or egg install); if this
is not available on your system you can either let the installer
itself get it from the internet (so just go to `Quick installation
instructions`_) or install it using your package manager, eg::

  aptitude install python-setuptools

or similar.

Please do not hesitate to contact `Oliver Beckstein`_ if problems
occur or if you have suggestions on how to improve the package or
these instructions.

Quick installation instructions
===============================

From a tar ball, eg GromacsWrapper-0.1.tbz::

   easy_install GromacsWrapper-0.1.tbz

From the unpacked source::

  python setup.py install

See the `easy_install instructions`__

.. __: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations

for explanation of the options that allow you to install into non-standard
places.



Requirements
============

Python_ and Gromacs_ must be installed. ipython_ is very much
recommended. These packages might already be available through your local
package manager such as ``aptitude/apt``, ``yum``, ``yast``, ``fink`` or
``macports``.

.. _Gromacs: http://www.gromacs.org
.. _ipython: http://ipython.scipy.org


System requirements
-------------------

Tested with python 2.4, 2.5 on Linux and Mac OS X.


Required python modules
-----------------------

The basic package only uses the standard library.

For the analysis library additional modules are required::

  numpy        >=1.0.3          http://numpy.scipy.org/
  matplotlib   >=0.91.3         http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
  RecSQL                        http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/oliver/download/Python/RecSQL

TODO
====
* Say how to make setup.py download the optional dependencies
  automagically.
* Example of non-standard install.
