 INSTALL
=========

This document should help you to install the package. The installation
uses setuptools (also known as easy_install or egg install); if this
is not available on your system you can either let the installer
itself get it from the internet (so just go to `Quick installation
instructions`_) or install it using your package manager, eg

  aptitude install python-setuptools

or similar.

Please do not hesitate to contact Oliver Beckstein
<orbeckst@gmail.com> if problems occur or if you have suggestions on
how to improve the package or these instructions.


Quick installation instructions
===============================

From a tar ball, eg GromacsWrapper-0.1.tbz:

   easy_install GromacsWrapper-0.1.tbz

From the unpacked source:

  python setup.py install

See the easy_install instructions for explanation of the options that
allow you to install into non-standard places.



Requirements
============

System requirements
-------------------

Tested with python 2.4, 2.5 on Linux and Mac OS X.

Required python modules
-----------------------

The basic package only uses the standard library.

For the analysis library additional modules are required::

  numpy        >=1.0.3          http://numpy.scipy.org/
  matplotlib   >=0.91.3         http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
  RecSQL                        http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/oliver/download/Python/RecSQL

:TODO: 
* Say how to make setup.py download the optional dependencies
  automagically.
* Example of non-standard install.
