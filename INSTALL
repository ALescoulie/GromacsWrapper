 INSTALL
=========

This document should help you to install the package. The installation
uses setuptools (also known as ``easy_install`` or egg install); if this
is not available on your system you can either let the installer
itself get it from the internet (so just go to `Quick installation
instructions`_) or install it using your package manager, eg::

  aptitude install python-setuptools

or similar.

Please do not hesitate to contact `Oliver Beckstein`_ if problems
occur or if you have suggestions on how to improve the package or
these instructions.

Quick installation instructions
===============================

From a tar ball, eg GromacsWrapper-0.1.tbz::

   easy_install GromacsWrapper-0.1.tbz

From the unpacked source::

  python setup.py install

See the `easy_install instructions`__

.. __: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations

for explanation of the options that allow you to install into non-standard
places.



Requirements
============

Python_ and Gromacs_ must be installed. ipython_ is very much
recommended. These packages might already be available through your local
package manager such as ``aptitude/apt``, ``yum``, ``yast``, ``fink`` or
``macports``.

.. _Gromacs: http://www.gromacs.org
.. _ipython: http://ipython.scipy.org


System requirements
-------------------

Tested with python 2.4, 2.5 on Linux and Mac OS X.


Required python modules
-----------------------

The basic package only uses the standard library.

For the analysis library additional modules are required::

  numpy        >=1.0.3          http://numpy.scipy.org/
  matplotlib   >=0.91.3         http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
  RecSQL       >=0.2            http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/oliver/download/Python/

See `Installing *all* packages and requirements`_ for hints on how to
do this.


Additional instructions
=======================

Installing *all* packages and requirements
------------------------------------------

If you want to make sure that ``easy_install`` also installs
requirements for optional modules then you will have to add the
additional requirement to the command line, for instance::

  easy_install GromacsWrapper-0.1.tbz[analysis]

or from the unpacked source::

  cd GromacsWrapper-0.1
  easy_install . GromacsWrapper[analysis]

in order to try to download additional packages for the additional
*analysis* module.

Note for Mac OS X users 
.......................

If automatic downloading of ``matplotlib`` fails then `download
matplotlib`_ manually and `install matplotlib manually`_ first. For
example,::

   wget http://kent.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/matplotlib/matplotlib-0.98.5.3-py2.5-macosx-10.3-fat.egg \
        -O matplotlib-0.98.5.3-py2.5.egg

   easy_install matplotlib-0.98.5.3-py2.5.egg

Note that you should look at the `download matplotlib`_ page to get
the latest distribution. As highlighted in the `matplotlib
installation FAQ`_ it is important to rename the ``egg`` file (as done
in the example above).

Possibly the following installation from the source distribution
works, too::

   easy_install matplotlib-0.98.5.3.tar.gz

Once this has been accomplished, try the above installation
instructions again; ``easy_install`` should now pick up the newly
installed matplotlib.
